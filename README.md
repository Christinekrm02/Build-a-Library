Create a superclass that will store shared functionality, then create three subclasses with functionality/properties as follows:

Getters: all properties have a getter
Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()

Movie
Properties: director (string), title (string), runTime (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty)
Getters: all properties have a getter

CD
Properties: artist (string), title (string), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty), songs (array of strings)
